Description: The packages allows to estimate causal Gaussian Bayesian Networks from a mixture of observation and intervention experiment. When the DAG structure G is known, parameters are estimated through simple linear regression. In the case where the DAG G is unknown, the posterior distribution P(G | data) is derived through a Metropolis-Hasting algorithm (MC3) where the score of each DAG G is obtained through a BIC (eBIC by default).
